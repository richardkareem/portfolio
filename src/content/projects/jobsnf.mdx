There are 2 types of applications, for website and mobile, for mobile it only provides job seekers, but for the website it provides job seekers and employers, here I help in developing the website and mobile, for mobile I made it myself while the website is with my team, for mobile it has not been deployed but for the website it can already be accessed.
